"Want to take a 2 minute breather?" 

I have added a question prompt over the video area to encourage the user to take a short break.

This kind of prompt is good for promoting mindful usage of the app.

"YES" and "SKIP" Buttons

These two buttons give users a choice to either take a break or continue using the app.

"YES" could lead to a calming screen or pause content, and "SKIP" would just dismiss the prompt.

Overlay Placement

The prompt and buttons are placed as an overlay on top of the video section.

This keeps the interaction visible without changing the main screen layout.

 Circular Progress Indicator (90%)
A circular visual element is placed in the center of the screen, showing "90%".

This represents how much of the short video the user has already watched.

It helps users quickly understand their current viewing progress without needing a traditional linear progress bar.

2. YouTube Play Button in the Center
Inside the circular progress, you've added a YouTube play icon which maintains the branding and context that itâ€™s a video.

It works as a focal point, drawing user attention to the center of the screen.
